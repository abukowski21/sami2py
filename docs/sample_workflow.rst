Sample Workflow
===============

In iPython, run:

.. code:: python

  import sami2py

If this is your first import of sami2py, it will remind you to set the top level directory that will hold the model output.  This should be a string containing the path to the directory you want to store the data in, such as ``path='/Users/me/data/sami2py'`` or ``path='C:\home\data'``.  This should be outside the main code directory, so model output files are not confused with model inputs or source code.  If you are using Git, it will also ensure that Git does not try to store your local code runs within the repository.

.. code:: python

  sami2py.utils.set_archive_dir(path=path)

sami2py will raise an error if this is not done before trying to run the model.

.. code:: python

  sami2py.run_model(tag='run_name', lon=0, year=2012, day=210)

Note that the sami2 model runs for 24 hours to clear transients, then begins to output data.

Now load the resultant data:

.. code:: python

  ModelRun = sami2py.Model(tag='run_name', lon=0, year=2012, day=210)

The data is stored as `ModelRun.data`, which is an `xarray.Dataset`.  Information about the run is stored as 'ModelRun.MetaData', which is a human-readable dictionary of the namelist.

The MetaData can be accessed directly via the dictionary, or through the __repr__.  Typing

.. code:: python

  ModelRun

yields

.. code:: python
